Port bugs:
    - Machine blocks have incorrect light in GUI?
    - Fluid level in machines seems to be not syncing properly with client.
    - Fluid slot in machine is somehow merging stacks.

Known bugs:
    Before Beta release:
        - Verify that it's possible to output 1g anitmatter cells.
        - When other mods fluids is used as default, tanks still contain the old one. (SEEMS TO BE FORGE BEHAVIOUR, NOT A BUG)

    High Priority:
        - Verify the breeding process - Should breeding reactors only create heat when actually enriched uranium is present in the middle?
        - Fix electric turbine sound, for both small and large.
        - Check if more turbines is more efficient than one big one.
        - Decrease turbine rotation speed?

    Low Priority:
        - JEI integration.
        - Store fluids in NBT on machine drop?
        - Verify that all sounds is more streamlined.
        - Reactors are only running when first opening GUI on world load. (NOT CONFIRMED).
        - Reactor fuel is not rendered when already in reactor on world load, only visible after entering GUI. Probably a client sync issue.
        - Overlook and implement more configuration options from Calclavia's mod.

Known features not implemented:

New features to add:
    Convenience:
        - Improve thermal system to be persistent thru NBT storage.
        - Make blocks store radiation in NBT somehow.
        - Add a Geiger counter to measure radiation.
        - Add ducrete, as a way to prevent radiation from seeping through walls? It's a way to reuse depleted uranium as a shielding material for waste storage/transportation
        - Implement IAntiPoisonBlock and add make radiation resistant blocks. (Raytrace).
        - Check if we should have a uranium hexaflouride container for gas centrifuge and nuclear boiler.
        - Add electromagnetic cell, a cell capable of holding antimatter?

    Enhancement:
        - Preserve inventory items in item block when destroying blocks.
        - Make antimatter and dark matter fluid items, 200 dl = 200 mg.
        - Make toxic waste spawn when reactor melts down, based on toxic waste amount in the reactor.
        - Turn sand into glass when exposed to high temperatures.
        - Make accelerator GUI show energy usage per 5 mg antimatter, as a measure of efficiency.
        - Make it more toxic to carry larger quantities of radioactive material. Like a whole stack of uranium.
        - Add support for vertical particle accelerators.
        - Add radiation resistance block which implements IAntiPoisonBlock. See EntityLivingBase.canEntityBeSeen()
        - Amplify sirens, with sort of multi block structure, also add pitch support for the multi block.
        - Add thorium fuel?
        - Add plasma decay event?
        - Add auto update support (https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/autoupdate/)
        - Add thermal capability that can be applied to tile entities.
        - Use mekanism's better performance redstone checks?
        - Make boiling water spawn particle rate based in the temperature. (https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/17620/equation-to-make-small-number-big-and-big-number-small-gravity)
        - Make tritium emit light when in a container.
        - Add ghost item support to quantum assembler.
        - Add pill that cures radiation poisoning, use function setCurativeItems() on potion effect to do that.
        - Add Mekanism recipes? NuclearCraft recipes? IC2 recipes?
        - Implement inventory automation for all machines. (NOT NECESSARY?)

    Rendering:
        - Render only moving parts in TESR's?

    Networking:
        - Optimize syncing of machines etc, only sync when gui is open etc.

    Energy:
        Chemical Extractor: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 RF = 27 Yellowcake (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Gas Centrifuge: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 2 Refined/Breading Uranium

        Nuclear Boiler: (DONE)
            128 MJ ~= 20000 = 8 Yellowcake creates 3200 L Uranium Hexaflouride (OK, but needs high throughput cables).

        Particle Accelerator: (DONE)
            5 mg antimatter (One particle accelerated to 100%) uses 97.85 MJ if inner circle is 100x100 blocks.

        Plasma Heater: (DONE)
            4 x 128MJ ~= 80000 = 2000 mB

        Quantum Assembler: (DONE)
            Per item = ((2 x 47) * 128MJ) - 22 MJ = (94 * 128 MJ) - 22 MJ = 12010 MJ (4804 RF?)

        Fulmination Generator: (DONE)
            125mg antimatter = 4523,52 MJ = 11310 FE

            1g antimatter = 35 * 128 MJ = 4480 MJ ~= 11310 FE

            Standard setup: (3 * 3 * 3) - 2 Fulmination Generator
                (((16 * 55) + 3) * 128) + 64 MJ = 113088 MJ
                113088 MJ / 25 Fulmination Generator = 4523,52 MJ per Fulmination Generator
                4523,52 MJ / 0,4 = 11308,8 FE ~= 11310 FE
